## Contributing
Before making changes to the project, create and checkout a new branch with `git checkout -b branch-name-here`. From this point, make whatever changes are needed, stage them with `git add .`, and commit with `git commit -m "descriptive description of changes"`.

To push your changes to the repository so that everyone else can see and work with them, run:

```git push --set-upstream origin branch-name-here```

Replace `branch-name-here` with the name you gave your branch.
